# ApexMate #

Fork of the original [superfell/ApexMate](https://github.com/superfell/ApexMate) with the following enhancements/changes:

* execute anonymous code
* changed keybinding for commands to match the standard TextMate convensions
* deploy page automatically opens page in browser after successful deployment

ApexMate is a plugin for the awesome OSX text editor TextMate. Using the plug-in you can easily save apex code to your Salesforce.com account, run tests etc.

You can download a prebuilt version of the plug-in from the Downloads area, to install unzip the file, which should leave you with Salesforce_com.tmbundle and move it to ~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/Bundles and enjoy.
