> ApexMate is a plugin for the awesome OSX text editor TextMate. Using the
> plug-in you can easily save apex code to your Salesforce.com account, run
> tests etc.

> You can download a prebuilt version of the plug-in from the Downloads
> area, to install unzip the file, which should leave you with
> Salesforce_com.tmbundle and move it to ~/Library/Application
> Support/TextMate/Bundles and enjoy.
